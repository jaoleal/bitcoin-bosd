# Contribution Guidelines

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

We accept contributions in the following forms (non-exhaustive):

- **Bug reports**: A good bug report includes a succinct,
  reproducible context and the intended behavior.
- **Feature requests**: Should be followed by a thorough explanation of why
  the feature is important. Please note that not all feature requests will be
  accepted. If in doubt, please consider opening a discussion first.
- **Pull requests**: Clear and correct code with explanatory documentation
  and comments if necessary. If adding new functionality or fixing bugs,
  we expect accompanying tests. Pull requests will undergo a review process,
  and if accepted, the changes will be incorporated into the codebase.
- **Discussions**: Contributions that cannot be framed as bug reports
  or pull requests are good candidates for discussions. Please be polite
  and present civilized arguments in discussions.
- **Security Reports**: If you believe you have found a vulnerability,
  please provide details [here](mailto:security@alpenlabs.io) instead.
